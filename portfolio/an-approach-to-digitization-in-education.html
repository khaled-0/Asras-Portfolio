        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          So far, there were no comparable offers, so my research applied to
          products from the field of e-learning, preferably with a focus on
          challenge-based learning and the target group children &amp;
          adolescents.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The creation of competitive profiles (in terms of marketing strategy,
          target market, core business, usability, layout, navigation structure,
          compatibility, content, design and performance) together with SWOT
          analysis helped to assess current offers in this area.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, general advantages and disadvantages of online courses and the
          question of how e-learning could be integrated into the context of
          conventional school forms was an important part of the research.

            <p class="insight-paragraph">
              Through self-learning systems, the learning process can be
              individually adapted for each student. Studies have shown, for
              example, that students who were considered weak in the classroom,
              after a short time with adaptive, tailor-made curricula many were
              even better than the previous best in class. These students simply
              needed more time for the basics, which then led to better and
              faster understanding of the more complex follow-up topics.

            <p class="insight-paragraph">
              Outdated or incorrect information can be updated at any time.
              Textbooks would therefore be obsolete and materials could no
              longer be forgotten or lost at home. Insofar as there is
              sufficient Internet access, global availability is possible.

              Through the on-demand availability, self-organization regarding
              time, place and topic becomes possible. The pure transfer of
              knowledge (know-how) takes place digitally, which gives the
              teacher more time to offer individual advice and orientation (Know
              Why). The knowledge broker role of the teacher shifts into the
              background in favor of the role as the student‘s companion and
              guide.

              There is no cost to buy textbooks, which will also make it easier
              for financially weak families to access education. In addition,
              e-learning contributes to the saving of financial, human and time
              resources, i.a. by simplifying various processes for schools,
              teachers and students.

              Students receive immediate feedback and can work with teachers and
              parents to follow their learning process. There is a risk of
              over-control and thus less self-organized learning, but also the
              chance to measure one&#x27;s own learning progress less with other
              students and instead with one&#x27;s own progress.

          grades five to thirteen.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul role="list">

            Which group constellation is preferred for the project work and why?

          <li>
            What is the willingness to become active within the meaning of the
            SDGs?
          </li>
          <li>What support is desired from students and teachers?</li>
          <li>
            To what extent are digital tools already being used for learning?
          </li>
          <li>
            What about digitization at the respective school? What are the
            obstacles in school life?<br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Based on the responses received, I formulated questions for an online
          survey that was answered by 202 people (about 75% teachers, 25%
          students) within one day – of course this survey is not
          representative, especially if you still have the differences between
          younger and more experienced teachers and between the different age
          groups of students.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Digitization could revolutionize the entire education sector. Not for
          the sake of digitization, but because, as also highlighted in the
          research, thereby an important and profound social change is possible:
          The change from the teacher to the learning companion; as Gunther
          Dueck would say, “from the right to the true man”; from the rigid
          transfer of knowledge to the human companion through a time in need of
          orientation. In general, I see here the great opportunity of
          digitization, namely that it gives people the opportunity to become
          “more human” – a more empathetic, collaborative and social learning
          and working culture.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed the course in three instead of the normally planned nine
          months and chose my own project. Due to the complexity of the project
          that I chose and the demanding course plan, I was able to implement
          hardly any major adjustments to the concept in the short time. Also,
          the training provided a digital solution, where I can imagine as the
          first prototype also analogous materials to increase the acceptance
          and feasibility in schools.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather, it requires a change in attitudes and investment in a reliable
          technical infrastructure before the full potential of digital
          platforms such as TINIA can be harnessed. Of course, this is an
          interplay and requires digital solutions that are worth upgrading or
          questioning attitudes.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          With the ambition to create a solution that can be adopted by schools,
          integrates sustainable development goals into school life and brings
          society and schools closer together, I was doomed to fail – the goal
          was far too vague and big. Also, I approached the project with too
          many strong ideas, which in retrospect was not conducive to reasonably
          responding to the research findings. My result is therefore rather an
          approximation and, above all, at the conceptual level requires further
          work, e.g. to facilitate a smarter group work.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also to be learned whether TINIA would prescribe a too strict
          course of Design Thinking, because Design Thinking is more of a
          mindset rather than a very concrete process (in terms of methods
          used). For this, it would need more experience from the field.<br />

          <li>
            Further iterations / test phases, actually test the course plan in a
            real classroom<br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>#1 Big challenges require small steps</strong> <br />Take
          small steps, because big changes can not be brought overnight,
          especially not just by an application alone. Accordingly, develop more
          strategically meaningful and realistically applicable tools that steer
          in the intended direction.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>#2 Be open to research and let ideas go <br />‍</strong>I
          thought too digitally and approached the product with too concrete
          ideas about the result, thus failing to correctly take into account
          some needs and challenges of the target group and thus unfavorably
          defined the minimum viable product.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>#3 Journey Maps are my new best friend <br />‍</strong
          >Especially as it gets more complex, Journey mapping is very helpful,
          on the one hand to put a comprehensive process on paper and to uncover
          problematic and promising points, on the other hand to provide a basis
          for good cooperation for all stakeholders.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>#4 Distribute polls via Facebook pages <br />‍</strong>More
          participation than expected, surprisingly many insights won and many
          answers to open questions received. Facebook pages with the
          appropriate fellowship and activity can quickly reach a relevant
          target group.<strong>‍</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>#5 Interview questions chosen unfavorably <br />‍</strong
          >Looking back, I would rebuild the interviews differently as I used
          too many questions where interviewees should imagine what the optimal
          solution might be (for example, “describe your dream school”).
          Especially through the book “<a
            target="_blank"
            href="http://momtestbook.com/de/"
            >The Mom Test</a
          >” I have been able to uncover many of my mistakes. It would have
          needed further interviews with teachers and school management (as well
          as parents) to create a more complete picture.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>#6 More substantive visual design <br />‍</strong>In the
          meantime, inasmuch as no visual language has yet been defined, I would
          define brand attributes in advance, which can be used to orient
          oneself with regard to the visual appearance as well as (linguistic)
          formulations – see my project for youth culture work.<br />
        </p>
        <h3>
          There are already good analogue materials, which I would like to
          recommend at this point.
        </h3>
        <p>
          For example, &quot;<a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://baut-eure-zukunft.eu/"
            >Build your future</a
          >&quot; provides very good materials to do design thinking projects in
          schools. It should be emphasized here that not only students, but
          primarily the teachers are very well taken by the hand and thus the
          inhibition threshold is lower to carry out such projects.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          For an entertaining insight into the topic of Design Thinking, e.g.
          suitable for single lessons,
          <a target="_blank" href="http://molly.is/writing/design-dash/"
            >Molly&#x27;s Design Dash</a
          >
          is great, especially if you replace the predefined topics with real
          school challenges and the opportunity to work on the projects beyond
          school time.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather with high school students in mind, there would be the
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.modelsofimpact.co/"
            >Models of Impact</a
          >
          Game, where based on societal challenges, social entrepreneurial
          business models are developed.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Also worth mentioning is IDEO&#x27;s
          <a target="_blank" href="https://designthinkingforeducators.com/"
            >Design Thinking for Educators</a
          >
          Toolkit, which has started a big movement here.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is e.g. also
          <a target="_blank" href="https://kahoot.com/">Kahoot!</a>,
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youthstart.eu/de/challenges/"
            >YouthStart</a
          >
          and
          <a target="_blank" href="http://dfcworld.com/SITE"
            >Design for Change</a
          >.
